# Vision

Currently planning to use rgb to hsv conversion followed by a gaussian blur along with a "Solid kernel" (derived from the sobel operator) on a image to isolate the "alien". 

We have also understood a majority of the quartus code from the starter project and know where we plan to insert and modify the current code to improve the image recognition.
